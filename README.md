Creative project for English 2463 Video Game Analysis at the Ohio State University.

Beneath the city's maze of neon-lit streets and towering skyscrapers, an intricate network of abandoned sewers and tunnels has become the stage for illegal cyber-enhanced brawls. You have been kidnapped and turned into a human fighting machine using new advanced technology. Face battles against intense competitors, modified creatures, and big bads. As the fights gain popularity, powerful individuals seek to control them, leading to a tense battle between underground organizers and corporate interests.
